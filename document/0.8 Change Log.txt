SEAS 0.8 is a complete overhaul of SEAS 0.7, everything is changed.
Here is a documentation of the major changes with SEAS 0.8 and the rationale behind some of the changes


****************************************
Add

1. Project based coding
	a. Added Example Folder, which includes code templates and project templates
	b. Each sub folder in example represent an project prototype that uses SEAS in different ways.
2. Data Analysis Tools
	a. Added Statistical and data analytic tools
3. Print Functions 
	a. indicate where it originate. 
	b. module level VERBOSE control 
4. Molecular Absorption
	a. HITRAN2016
5. Reflection Spectra
	a. Planet albedo
6. Stellar Spectra (needed for better noise calculation)

N. New utilties:
	a. Pandas
	b. Tqdm

****************************************
Change

1. Configuration Files:
	a. Break down configuration files into multiple files, each controlling specific parts of the code. 
	b. Added location for all configuration files, used as default
	c. Within each project, there will be a project specific configuration files that overwrites the default

2. Cross Section Grid:
	a. Cross section grids are saved independently so that it doesn't have to be regenerated for each atmosphere type/model
	b. Much higher temperature coverage (Seperate Grids) for non-biosignature purposes
	c. Expand to cover warm neptunes and hot jupiters

3. Change all except to except Exceptions.

****************************************
Delete

1. Removed Database:
	a. Generally hard to debug/spin-off using databases. 
	b. Sharp re/learning curve for using database for cross sections
	c. May reinitiate for speed issues. Will reevaluate this issue when benchmarking
