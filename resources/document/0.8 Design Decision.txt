Ideologies:
1. Project oriented.
2. All gases are treated equally as bio/main
3. Expanded BiosigSEAS to be a more generalized SEAS so that it can be used for retireval
	a. Broader Wavelength coverage ? 
	b. Broader Temperature coverage (multiple cross section grids)

Code Framework need rework
	The current framework is very linear and not task specific
	A rework of the framework is anticipated so that we can run
	multiple different simulation from different teams possible.
	Also, code should be made more robust so that "modding" of
	the code is more trivial.
	
	The code should also anticipate future Retrieval and MCMC
	implementation

Multiprocessing
	Retrieval will need multiprocessing
	Think about how SEAS can benefit from multiprocessing
	Also think about notion of multiple biosignatures

Errorbar on cross section
	Think about how error bar will propagate for molecules that only have spectral data
	a smarter and more automatic way to do "automatic baseline correction" for NIST measured spectra
		
Rework the noise and error implementation for more robust additions
	noise has its own separate class
	how to implement error is still TBD

Users:
	Think about how people will use SEAS
	What kind of documentation people will want to read


Pressure:
	Take a detail look at astrophysical properties and simulating planets with different 
	surface pressure. think about how to handle planets with different surface pressure
	
Rework Cross section generation... 
	need to look at temperature/pressure scaling. 
	rework the line_list_to_cross_Section_calculation. Just use HAPI

Redo Mie Code
	write my own mie code please... understand the mie theory.
	robust dust module
	fix rayleigh scattering

need to build a tool to read pdf/images
	apply this to both pnnl data and vpl data

	
		
	Different Cloud types?
		cirrus cloud
		cumulus cloud
		CO2 clouds? other clouds?
	
	xkcd font (perlin noise)
	ALpy (science plotting)


add more data for CIA: H2-N2, H2-CO2, N2-CO2, N2-N2, CO2-CO2
