# SEAS
Simulator for Exoplanet Atmosphere Spectra (SEAS)
-- Exoplanet Atmosphere Benchmark/validation/sanity check tool

# Installation
Code download and installation using command line:

1. git clone https://github.com/zhuchangzhan/SEAS.git
2. virtualenv SEAS_Env
3. Source SEAS_Env/Bin/Activate
4. pip install requirements.txt

# Testing the code:
All tested execution files are under /bin
Some simple functionalities and code demos will work without cross section database.
However, to use the full functionality of the code, including generating your own spectra,
will require creating your own absorption cross section database. 
The code for this is under Example/...

# Generating the Molecular Absorption Cross Section Database
(This will take a very very long time. ~A few days and take up about 5GB of Storage)
